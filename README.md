# Graphical-Calculator
The objective of this project was to create a Java application program where a graphing calculator appears, and the user can enter an equation, validate the equation and display those results in the graphical form.
This project includes two panels where in one panel user enters polynomial or trigonometric equation, enters the x-axis and y-axis range of the equation, plot and erase button to plot the graph & erase the graph respectively, one combobox to select the color of the graph equation, one JList to store all the valid equations and load button to load the selected equation from JList to display in graph. The other panel includes the graph which is plotted for the given equation in the other panel.
This project implements a flow layout and uses concepts like encapsulation, modularity and hierarchy from Object Oriented Principles.
This project has additional panel of scientific calculator which includes all the features of project scientific calculator.
